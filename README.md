# Feature-detection-of-a-RGB-Image-Process
This project features a base class, CommonProcesses, for standard RGB image processing. The derived Detection class handles common detection tasks, with subclasses like LineDetection and CornerDetection specializing in line and corner detection. The project establishes a hierarchy from general image processing to feature detection.
